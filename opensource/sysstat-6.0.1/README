(C) 1999-2005 Sebastien Godard (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr)

The latest version of sysstat can always be found on my web site at:

http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/

sysstat package is also available at ibiblio's Linux archive
in the following directory:

ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/status/

See the CHANGES file to know the new features/improvements/bug fixes added
in this release of sysstat.


INSTALLATION
------------

The sysstat utilities are a collection of performance monitoring tools for
Linux. These include mpstat, iostat, sar, sadc, sadf and sa tools. 

The first stage is to configure sysstat for your system:

	make config

This is useful to change some configuration variables, for instance if you
want to choose installation directories.
Answer the questions or enter Return to accept the default values.
For yes/no questions, please answer 'y' or 'n' (without the quotes): It is
case sensitive! You can also enter '?' to get a help message.
Configuring your system is not compulsory. If not done, sysstat will use
a default configuration file...

The next stage is to build the various binary files. Enter:

	make

Then log in as root and enter:

	make install

(see next section to know the files that are installed).
That's all!

Of course tell me if there are any problems. This is the only way I can improve
'sysstat'. Please also remember to read the FAQ included in this package.

With regard to sysstat, patches and suggestions for improvements are always
welcome! Send them to (sysstat <at> wanadoo.fr).


FILES THAT ARE INSTALLED
------------------------

I _hate_ when packages install files everywhere on my disk and I don't know
where...
So here is the list of files installed by sysstat, when you ask for a
complete installation.
${PREFIX} is the value of the PREFIX variable defined in the Makefile
(usually set to /usr/local or /usr).

${RC_DIR}=/etc/			for [DEBIAN]


MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

The sar, mpstat and iostat commands are only front-ends to the kernel proc
filesystem... They cannot display statistics that Linux does not
provide, nor can they be more accurate than Linux is.
The sysstat package has been tested on Linux kernels 2.0.x, 2.2.x, 2.4.x and
2.6.x, but since new statistics are added in sysstat, they are not necessarily
present in old kernels.

It has been designed with National Language Support (NLS) in mind, using
the GNU gettext package (available at http://www.gnu.org).
At the present time, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese,
Afrikaans, Norwegian, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Polish, Slovak and
Japanese translations are available. You are welcome if you want to make
other languages available ;-)
Please read the README-nls file in the nls directory before.
