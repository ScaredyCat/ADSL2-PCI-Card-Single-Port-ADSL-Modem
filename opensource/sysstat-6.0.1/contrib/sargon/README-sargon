Sebastien,

I've been using a replacement script for sa1/sa2 for several years now.
Instead of maintaining a flat structure of logfiles under /var/log/sa, it
keeps the logfiles organized by month (so that there can be more than one
month's worth of data on the system), and it also maintains a set of
symbolic links to mimic the standard datafile structure.  The directory
structure that results under /var/log/sa looks like this:

   drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Feb 28 00:00 200202
   drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Mar 31 00:00 200203
   drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Apr  4 00:00 200204
   -rw-r--r--    1 root     root            0 Apr  4 03:00 LASTMAINT
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Apr  1 23:55 sa01 -> 200204/sa01
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Apr  2 23:55 sa02 -> 200204/sa02
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Apr  3 23:55 sa03 -> 200204/sa03
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Apr  4 16:10 sa04 -> 200204/sa04
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Mar  5 23:55 sa05 -> 200203/sa05
   lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Mar  6 23:55 sa06 -> 200203/sa06
   [...etc...]

This is very useful in situations where you need to be able to go back a
few months to compare current performance to a previous baseline.  The
script takes care of deleting old datafiles, and it will also compress old
datafiles after a specified amount of time (default is to keep 400 days
worth of datafiles, and compress after 180 days).  You run it periodically
just as you would sa1 (and there's no longer a need to run sa2).

It was originally written for Solaris systems, but I recently modified it
so that I could use it on Redhat systems as well.  Since you maintain the
sysstat package, I thought you might be interested in it.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
-----------------

I have modified the original sargon script written by John.
It must be called now as:

sargon [interval] [count] [days-to-keep] [days-to-keep-uncompressed]

You can put the following line in your crontab:

0 * * * * /usr/local/lib/sa/sargon 600 6 180 10 &

Note that the LINUX RESTART message is not included in
the daily data file if you use sargon instead of the
sa1/sa2 scripts. To fix this, you will have to update
the sysstat.sh script, which should be pretty easy.
