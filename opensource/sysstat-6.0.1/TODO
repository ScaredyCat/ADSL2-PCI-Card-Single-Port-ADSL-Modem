Here are the things I would like (or I should) do for the next releases:

* Add a vmstat command (not sure about this, since it already exists in common
  Linux distributions).

* Add more statistics to sar and mpstat (and iostat) when available in Linux
  kernels.
  Numerous network activities are already available (see /proc/snmp for
  example), but I am rather reluctant to display them: There are too many of
  them and sar becomes bigger and bigger...

* Try to add new fields to sar -B and sar -W (pgscan, pgfree, pgsteal, etc.).

* Use autoconf to configure sysstat.

* Add support for hotplug CPU ?

* Dynamically allocate structures for IRQs (just like for CPUs).
