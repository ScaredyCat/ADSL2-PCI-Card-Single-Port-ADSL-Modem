WHAT IS NLS?
------------
NLS stands for National Language Support. It encompasses the features that make
a program able to support different languages and cultural habits.
This touches the messages displayed on the screen, but also the format used to
display the dates or the numbers for example.


HOW I ENABLE NLS WITH SYSSTAT?
------------------------------
That's easy: Answer 'y' (for 'yes') to the question:
"Enable National Language Support (NLS)? [y]"
during configuration stage ('make config').
Beginning with sysstat release 3.2.2, NLS is now enabled by default.


OK, BUT HOW DO I USE IT NOW?
------------------------------
You have to set your LANG environment variable to the proper value.
E.g.:
	France: fr_FR
	Germany: de_DE
	Spain: es_ES
	Brazil: pt_BR
	South Africa: af_ZA
	Norway: nb_NO or nn_NO
	Italy: it_IT
	Russia: ru_RU
	Romania: ro_RO
	Poland: pl_PL
	Slovakia: sk_SK
	Japan: ja_JP

although other possibilities exist.
If you use bash and you want to configure your system for a french environment,
enter:

$ export LANG=fr_FR

('$' is the prompt).
If you use the (Tab) C shell, you would have entered:

% setenv LANG fr_FR

('%' is the prompt).
Here is a complete example with iostat:

$ export LANG=en_US
$ iostat -V 
sysstat version 5.1.4
(C) Sebastien Godard
Usage: iostat [ options... ] [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
Options are:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]

$ export LANG=fr_FR
$ iostat -V
sysstat version 5.1.4
(C) Sebastien Godard
Utilisation: iostat [ options... ] [ <intervalle> [ <itérations> ] ]
Options possibles:
[ -c | -d ] [ -k ] [ -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ]
[ { <device> [ ... ] | ALL } ] [ -p [ { <device> | ALL } ] ]


HOW CAN I ADD A NEW LANGUAGE TO SYSSTAT?
----------------------------------------
At the present time, sysstat is translated into English, French, German,
Spanish, Portuguese, Afrikaans, Norwegian, Italian, Russian, Romanian,
Polish, Slovak and Japanese.
To add another language, copy an existing Portable Object file (LANG.po) in
one of your directories (you can copy the file named fr.po for instance).
Update the header of that file to give your name and email address.
Then you have to translate all the messages quoted in the lines beginning
with the 'msgid' token...
Last, mail me this file for inclusion in the next release of sysstat!

For more information, read the documentation coming with the GNU 'gettext'
package (enter 'info gettext').
