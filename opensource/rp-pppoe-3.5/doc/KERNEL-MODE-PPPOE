RP-PPPoE now supports kernel-mode PPPoE on Linux kernels 2.4.x.  However,
the default "./go" build procedure does not make kernel-mode support.

Here's what you need to do:

0) Make sure you are running kernel 2.4.x on the machine you will build
rp-pppoe on.  You must have the following kernel configuration settings:

	CONFIG_PPP=m          or CONFIG_PPP=y
	CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=m    or CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=y
	CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY=m or CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY=y
	CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=m  or CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=y
	CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=m  or CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=y
	CONFIG_PPPOE=m        or CONFIG_PPPOE=y
	CONFIG_N_HDLC=m       or CONFIG_N_HDLC=y
	CONFIG_UNIX98_PTYS=y

You also need a /dev/ppp file:

	mknod --mode=664 /dev/ppp c 108 0

You might want to add these lines to /etc/modules.conf:

	alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
	alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
	alias tty-ldisc-13 n_hdlc
	alias tty-ldisc-14 ppp_synctty
	alias net-pf-24 pppoe

1) Check out the latest version of the PPP software from the CVS
repository at cvs.samba.org.  Here's how to do this:

	cvs -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot login
	# When prompted for a password, type "cvs"

	# Change to the directory in which you want to store the PPP source
	# code.
	cd /path/to/checked/out/sources

	# Check out the source
	cvs -z5 -d :pserver:cvs@pserver.samba.org:/cvsroot co ppp

2) The source gets checked out into a subdirectory called ppp.  If
the source ends up in /path/to/checked/out/sources/ppp, then call
that path $PPPDIR.

Build and install the checked-out ppp code according to its instructions.

3) Unpack rp-pppoe.

3) In the rp-pppoe directory, change to src/ and type:

	./configure --enable-plugin=$PPPDIR

where $PPPDIR, of course, refers to the checked-out "ppp" directory
from cvs.samba.org.

4) Type make; make install

5) Edit /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf to include this line:

	LINUX_PLUGIN=/etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so

After that, adsl-start should use kernel-mode PPPoE.

This code is experimental and unsupported.  Use at your own risk.
