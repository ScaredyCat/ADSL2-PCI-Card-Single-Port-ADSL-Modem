.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Ifrename 
is a tool allowing you to assign a consistent name to each of your
network interface.
.PP
By default, interface names are dynamic, and each network interface is
assigned the first available name
.RI ( eth0 ", " eth1 "...)."
The order network interfaces are created may vary. For built-in
interfaces, the kernel boot time enumeration may vary. For removable
interface, the user may plug them in any order.
.PP
.B Ifrename
allow the user to decide what name a network interface will have.
.B Ifrename 
can use a variety of
.I selectors
to specify how interface names match the network interfaces on the
system, the most common selector is the interface 
.IR "MAC address" .
.PP
.B Ifrename
must be run before interfaces are brought up, which is why it's mostly
useful in various scripts (init, hotplug) but is seldom used directly
by the user. By default,
.B ifrename 
renames all present system interfaces using mappings defined in
.IR /etc/iftab .
.\"
.\" PARAMETER part
.\"
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.BI "-c " configfile
Set the configuration file to be used (by default 
.IR /etc/iftab ).
The configuration file define the mapping between selectors and
interface names, and is described in
.IR iftab (5).
.br
If
.I configfile
is "-", the configuration is read from stdin.
.TP
.B -p
Probe (load) kernel modules before renaming interfaces. By default
.B ifrename 
only check interfaces already loaded, and doesn't auto-load the
required kernel modules. This option enables smooth integration with
system not loading modules before calling
.BR ifrename .
.TP
.B -d
Enable various
.B Debian
specific hacks. Combined with
.BR -p ,
only modules for interfaces specified in
.I /etc/network/interface
are loaded.
.TP
.BI "-i " interface
Only rename the specified
.I interface 
as opposed to all interfaces on the system. The new interface name is
printed.
.TP
.BI "-n " newname
When used with
.IR -i ,
specify the new name of the interface. The list of mappings from the
configuration file is bypassed. The new name may be a wildcard
containing a single '*'.
