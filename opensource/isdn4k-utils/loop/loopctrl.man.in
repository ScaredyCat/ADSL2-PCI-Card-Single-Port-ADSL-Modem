.TH LOOPCTRL 8 "@MANDATE@" isdn4k-utils-@I4LVERSION@ "Linux System Administration"
.SH NAME
loopctrl \- configure isdnloop ISDN driver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B loopctrl [-d
.IB Driver-Id ]
.I action options
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B loopctrl
is used to setup the isdnloop
.SM ISDN
driver.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " Driver-Id
selects the virtual S0 interface named by
.IR Driver-Id .
Driver-Ids are defined during driver initialisation. See
.BR isdnloop (4)
for a description of the syntax to be used for modularised and
monolithic driver versions.
This option
.B must
be used to identify the virtual S0 interface if more than one S0 interface is
existent. If a single virtual S0 interface is used, it may be omitted.
If using more than one virtual card, support for the other cards is enabled
with the
.B add
action of loopctrl. Ids may
.B not
start with
.B digits
or small
.BR x ,
because these values are misinterpreted
as numeric parameters by
.BR insmod .
For loading the module, always the
newest
.B modutils
package should be used to avoid problems during load.
.LP
The following 
.I actions
may be given to
.BR loopctrl .
.TP
.BI "add [" id ]
enables support for an additional virtual card in the driver. If
.I id
is missing, adds a card with an id given by the system. with
.I id
given, adds a card with an Id given by the user. Ids are
checked against conflicts, and if a conflict happens, replaced by the
system in the same manner as if no Id was supplied.
.TP
.B leased on|off
switches between normal (dialup) and leased-line mode. Leased-line mode
is intended for usage with S64K-lines or - if both channels are used -
for S02. These lines do not have a D-channel. When leased-line mode is
enabled, the driver simulates incoming calls using special "phone-numbers"
for calling and called address which are generated as follows:
.ie 1
.RS
Calling number:
.RS
.BI LEASED x
.RS
where
.I x
is the internal slot-number of the S0 interface. This number starts with
.I 0
for the first S0 interface and is incremented by one for every S0 interface
configured using the
.B add
action.
.RE
.RE
.ie 1
Called number:
.RS
.I x
.RS
where
.I x
is equal to the channel number of the calling S0 interface starting with
.IR 1 .
.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI "start " protocol " " phone1 " [" "phone2 phone3" ]
starts the driver with the given D-channel protocol. If
.I protocol
.RB "is " 1tr6 ,
.RI only " phone1"
has to be given. It is meant to be the base number of the virtual
S0 interface to which the EAZ is appended. If
.I protocol
.RB "is " dss1 ,
.IR "phone1, phone2 " and " phone3
have to be given and represent the three MSNs of the virtual
S0 interface.
.TP
.B dump
is available if the program is configured using the
.B --enable-dump
option only. The contents of internal driver variables is dumped on stdout.
.SH BUGS
This program and the isdnloop driver are
.B ALPHA
code. The main intention for this driver is for testing the link level
and applications.
