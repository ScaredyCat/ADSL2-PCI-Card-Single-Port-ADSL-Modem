What is freecdb?
---------------

It's a totally-public domain fork of cdb. cdb was originally created
by Dan Bernstein. See the original web page at 
ftp://koobera.math.uic.edu/www/cdb.html for more on cdb.


Why did you rewrite everything except the C sources?
---------------------------------------------------

Because Dan Bernstein restricted their copying too much. I wanted to
use cdb freely, and distribute as I wished.

Please see http://www.debian.org/intro/free for a introduction on what
I mean with "free".


What did you do, exactly?
------------------------

I rewrote the man pages, build system and some other details.

Converting the man pages to *roff format needs pod2man (from Perl),
and the build system needs GNU Make. You want to install Perl and GNU
Make anyway. You really do.


But you broke portability!
-------------------------

Might very well be true. I don't have experience with much else than
Linux, and I'm nowhere near as capable of ensuring portability as DJB
himself. Please tell me what I broke and I'll fix it.


It doesn't work anymore!
-----------------------

Oops. File a bug at http://bugs.debian.org/ and I'll see what I can do.


I hate you for doing this! You free software biggots are all alike!
------------------------------------------------------------------

And you self-centered non-sharers, too! You don't frighten us, English
pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! Ah blow my
nose at you, so-called Arthur king! You and all your silly English
k-nnnnnn-ighuts! Pttttht!


What a strange person!
---------------------

Ah don't wanna talk to you anymore, you empty-headed animal foodtrough
water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelled of elderberries!
