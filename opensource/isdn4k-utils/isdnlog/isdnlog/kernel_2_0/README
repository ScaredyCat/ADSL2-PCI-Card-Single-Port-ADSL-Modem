This is the README for kernel_2_0/iiocnetgpn.c

As my isdnlog 4.50 running on kernel 2.0.36 (isdn ~2.0.38) doesn't
set the huptime always, I wrote this small addition, for usage with
2.0 kernels.

The code is ugly (kernel headers are included, with __KERNEL__ defined,
there are some warnings (which can be ignored), but it seems to work.
You can try the code standalone, look at the file for a short description.


So to use this feature, compile isdnlog with:

touch isdnlog/processor.c
make IIOCNETGPN=1

Before:

isdnlog: to Magnet-N with ''  No HUP: HUP = 1 c = 8 *INTERFACE=

(so interface was not found)


After:

isdnlog: (ISDN subsystem with ISDN_MAX_CHANNELS > 16 detected, \
         ioctl(IIOCNETGPN) is available)
isdnlog: isdn.conf:2 active channels, 8 MSN/SI entries
isdnlog: (watching "/dev/isdnctrl0" as HFC/echo mode)
isdnlog: (Data versions: iprofd=0x04  net_cfg=0x04  /dev/isdninfo=0x01)
isdnlog: Everything is fine, isdnlog-4.51 is running in full featured mode.
...
isdnlog: to Magnet-N with ''  INTERFACE ippp0 calling 071891xxxx
...
isdnlog: to Magnet-N with ''  NEXT CI AFTER 03:00 \
      (Telekom Austria Min.tarif, Internet, Werktag (Dienstag), Geschäftszeit)
isdnlog: to Magnet-N with ''  CHARGEINT ippp0 180 (was 160)
isdnlog: to Magnet-N with ''  HUPTIMEOUT ippp0 8 (was 60)
