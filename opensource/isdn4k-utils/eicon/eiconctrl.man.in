.TH EICONCTRL 8 "@MANDATE@" eiconctrl-V2.3 "Linux System Administration"
.SH NAME
eiconctrl \- configure Eicon active ISDN card 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eiconctrl [-d
.IB Driver-Id ]
.I action options
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B eiconctrl
is used to setup the Eicon
.SM ISDN
device driver and for downloading the firmware into the
.SM ISDN
card.
.LP
The use of
.I eiconctrl
makes sense, if you are using an active Eicon ISDN card only.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " Driver-Id
selects the S0/S2M interface named by
.IR Driver-Id .
Driver-Ids are defined during driver initialisation. See
.BR README.eicon
for a description of the syntax to be used for modularised and
monolithic driver versions.
This option
.B must
be used to identify the S0/S2M interface if more than one S0/S2M interface is
existent. If a single card is used, it may be omitted.
If using more than one ISA-Bus-type card, support for the other cards
is enabled with the
.B add
action of eiconctrl. PCI-Bus-type cards will be automatically added
during driver initialisation. Ids may
.B not
start with
.B digits
or small
.BR x ,
because these values are misinterpreted
as numeric parameters by
.BR insmod .
For loading the module, always the
newest
.B modutils
package should be used to avoid problems during load.
.LP
The following 
.I actions
may be given to
.BR eiconctrl .
.TP
.BI "irq [" "interrupt" ]
sets the irq number to use (only ISA).
If the interrupt value is omitted, the current setting will be printed.
.TP
.BI "load "   " protocol " " [options]
Downloads the protocol- and dsp-code into the card and starts operation.
.LP
.RS
.BR protocol
.br
.BR etsi " Euro-ISDN E-DSS1 (default)"
.br
.BR 1tr6 " German ISDN Protocol"
.br
.BR .... " other protocols are also possible"

For options see
.I eiconctrl
without any parameters for ISA cards
and
.I eiconctrl divaload -h
for PCI cards.
.br
.RE
.LP
.TP
.BI "manage " [read | exec " " <path>]
Starts Management-Interface.
.TP
.BI "xlog " [cont | <filename>]
Retrieving XLOG entries of adapter.
With option
.I cont
given, it will be on a continuous cycle.
Using a driver release 1.77 or newer you can specify a
trace-file for the xlog interpreter.
.TP
.BI "isdnlog " [on | off]
Switch trace-information for isdnlog on/off.
.LP
.LP
.LP
.SH CARD SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS
.TP
.BI "COMMON to all BRI-ISA"
When using BRI-PtP set -S1 -n -t0 options. Some (very rare) switches
require the -S2 here.The offset, set by the on-boards jumpers needs
an additional '0' (f.e. Cards jumper setup is 0xd800 - means a membase of 0xd8000 ).
.TP
.BI "S SX SXn SCOM"
when loading the card's module by insmod / modprobe, you need
to specify Membase, IRQ and ID. Only the SCOM is also MCA-supported.
.TP
.BI "S2M"
When using PRI-PtP set -n -S2
.TP
.BI "QUADRO"
Loading this card as usual will automatically find and autoload the
remaining three cards. Don't forget to set the Membase, IRQ and ID string
using insmod or modprobe. Remember to "eiconctrl load <card_n>" for all "four" cards
manually with the desired protocol. When setting the ID's last letter to an "a",
the remaining ID's will be continued with "b, c, d" ; Otherwise the ID-string
will add a "_2 _3 _4" to the cards device-description.
.TP
.BI "COMMON to all BRI/PRI PCI"
All cards are auto detected and autoloaded w/o any parameters at insmod/modprobe.
Using more than one card in a system will require the eiconctrl "-d" option to
load the futher cards. (f.e eiconctrl -d eicon2) You can also use the -all option to
get all boards loaded at one time (divaload only). The ETSI protocol is default and
is not needed to be set as parm. Otherwise add the desired protocol to specify. The
protocolcodes are normally located at /usr/lib/isdn/eicon.
.TP
.BI "4BRI"
Loading this card will set the protocol to all "4 cards" same style. You cannot
load diffrent codes. This is not a bug! The ID's are set while loading -
automatically.
.TP
.BI "PRI"
When using PRI-PtP set -n -S2
.br
Use option -x to set NT mode.
.TP


.SH EXAMPLE 
.TP
.BI eiconctrl " load etsi"
loads and starts S0 type adapter with protocol E-DSS1.
.TP
.BI eiconctrl " load etsi -t1 -s1 -n"
loads and starts S0 type adapter with protocol E-DSS1 PtP.
.TP
.BI eiconctrl " load etsi -s2 -n"
loads and starts S2M type adapter with protocol E-DSS1.
