Introduction.
*************

The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to transmit
datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the
machines at either end of the link (the `peers') to negotiate various
optional characteristics of the link.  Using PPP, a serial link can be
used to transmit Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams, allowing TCP/IP
connections between the peers.  PPP is defined in several RFC (Request
For Comments) documents, in particular RFCs 1661, 1662, 1332 and 1334.
Other RFCs describe standard ways to transmit datagrams from other
network protocols (e.g., DECnet, OSI, Appletalk), but this package
only supports IP.


This implementation consists of two parts:

- kernel code, which implements an interface between the isdn4linux
  subsystem and the networking code. The interface also forwards
  control frames to the ippp-device

- The PPP daemon (ipppd), which negotiates with the peer to establish
  the link and configures the ippp network interface. Ipppd includes 
  support for authentication, so you can control which other systems 
  may make a PPP connection and what IP addresses they may use.
