.SH NAME
iprofd \- Modem-register daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI iprofd " registerfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iprofd
is used to make the modem-register settings of the isdn-ttys AT-emulator
permanent and restore them during boot-time. It is usually started from within
a rc-script and puts itself into background. If
.I registerfile
already exists at startup, all modem-registers are restored from it's
contents. After that,
.B iprofd
waits for getting a signal from the isdn-subsystem. Every time, a 'AT&W0'
command is given at an isdn-tty the isdn-subsystem sends a SIGIO and
.B iprofd
reads the current settings of the modem-registers and stores them into
.IR registerfile .
