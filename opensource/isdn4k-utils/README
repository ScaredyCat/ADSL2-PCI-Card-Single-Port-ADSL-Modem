  audio: the answering machine vbox
  additional: ipppcomp ipppstats iprofd xisdnload xmonisdn

  hardware-dependent packages:
  hisax:   tools for passive isdn cards
  avmb1:   tools for the AVM B1/T1/M1/M2 *active* cards
           (not for Fritz!classic, Fritz!pnp, Fritz!PCI, these are in hisax)
  act2000: tools for IBM Active 2000

System prerequisites:

  To use this package, you need a kernel with an ISDN-subsystem configured.
  To get a such a kernel, take a clean standard-kernel (Version > 2.0.37 or
  > 2.2.14 resp.) enable the isdn-related features you want and build the
  kernel as usual. Older kernels may work as well, but bugs have been found 
  and fixed, so better use the recommended versions (or above)

3. Configuration, Compilation.

   Run "make config"

   This will run an interactive configuration tool and the various
   configuration-scripts for each sub-package. (You may know that
   tool from kernel menuconfig.)
   There is a global configuration directory, where most programs
   expect their configuration files. The default is /etc/isdn.

   - Alternatively you can edit the .config file by hand (once that
     has been created once with "make config"), and run "make subconfig"
     instead. This might be useful if you want to automate the building
     of the package, e.g. for a Red Hat rpm or a Debian deb.
   
   Run "make"

   This builds all previously selected utilities.

4. Installation

   For the following steps, root permissions are necessary

   Install the utilities, the man pages and config-files:

     make install

   The config files usually are installed in /etc/isdn if not
   specified otherwise during configuration.

   If no existing ISDN devices in /dev are detected (via an admittedly
   simple test), script/makedev.sh is run during "make install". Check
   that the permissions / groups are suitable for your needs.
   You can run the makedev.sh script again if necessary.

5. Application

   The directory ./etc contains an example startup-script which gets
   not installed automatically, because it MUST BE CONFIGURED IN ANY
   CASE! Please don't try to connect to the Internet without setting
   your own IP-addresses. This script is intended to be used with
   the modularised version of the ISDN-subsystem. Refer to the
   Documentation/isdn subdirectory of your kernel-source-tree for
   more information on configuring Lowlevel drivers.

   For the utilities refer to the man pages or look into their
   subdirectories for Documentation.

   For tips, troubleshooting etc. look into the FAQ subdirectory.
