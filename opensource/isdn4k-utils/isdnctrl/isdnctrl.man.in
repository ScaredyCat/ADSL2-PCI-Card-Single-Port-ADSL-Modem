.SH NAME
isdnctrl \- get/set ISDN device information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI isdnctrl " action device " ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isdnctrl
is used to create and delete network interfaces for
.SM ISDN,
set up the various parameters and phone numbers for dial in and dial
out. It is also used to list the current parameters of an already
configured network interface.
.BR isdnctrl " is " not
needed for configuration of
.SM ISDN
ttys!
.LP
The use of
.B isdnctrl
is independent of the hardware driver.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
The following 
.B actions
may be given to
.BR isdnctrl .
.TP
.BI addif " name"
Adds a new
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name " to the kernel. If " name
is omitted, the kernel will use
.BI eth X,
where
.I X
is an increasing number starting from 0. This is probably not useful with
.SM ISDN
so using a name like
.B isdn0
(for raw ip interfaces) or
.B ippp0
(for synchronous PPP interfaces)
is always recommended.
.TP
.BI delif " name " [force]
Removes the
.SM ISDN
interface
.I name
from the kernel. If the optional keyword
.B force
is appended,
.BR isdnctrl " executes"
.BI ifconfig " name " down
before removing it.
.TP
.B reset [force]
Removes all
.SM ISDN
interfaces from the kernel if it is possible. If the optional keyword
.B force
is appended,
.BR isdnctrl " executes"
.BI ifconfig " name " down
before removing an interface.
.TP
.BI ifdefaults " name "
resets the interface
.IR name
to some reasonable defaults.
.TP
.BI dialmode " name " [ off | manual | auto ]
Sets the dial mode of the interface to one of:
.LP
.RS
.B off
.br
no connection can be made; an existing connection is terminated immediately.
Incoming connections are also not possible.
.LP
.B manual
.br
manual dialing / hangup;
a connection will only be made after
.B isdnctrl dial
.I name
but the line will be disconnected after the huptimeout value set if using
kernel drivers updated since 1 Nov 1998; otherwise an explicit
.B isdnctrl hangup
.I name
will be needed to cause the connection to be dropped.
.br
Incoming connections are possible; however, if this interface is configured in
.BR "callback in"
mode, the callback dial will not happen (as this is actually an outgoing
connection, not an incoming one).
.LP
.B auto
.br
autodial mode; an outgoing packet will trigger a dialout, and a hangup will
occur after the huptimeout value specified (see below).
.br
An interface in
.BR auto
dial mode will call another system back (if configured in
.BR "callback in"
mode).
.LP
.br
.B auto
was the "old" behaviour (as it was before
.BR dialmode
was implemented).
.br
.LP
.br
If no argument is given, the current dialmode value is displayed.
.br
.LP
.br
You can give
.BR all
as the interface name; the command will then be executed for all interfaces.
.RE
.TP
.BI addphone " name " out " num"
Adds the phone number
.I num
to the list of outgoing numbers of the
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name .
Numbers in this list are used to dial the remote station if
the connection is down and packets are to be sent via the interface
(Dial on demand). More than one number can be set by calling
.B isdnctrl addphone
repeatedly. If more than one number is set, these will be tried
one after another (the last added number is tried first, etc.).
When using a german SPV-type connection,
the number has to be prefixed by a capital S.
.TP
.BI addphone " name " in " num"
Adds the phone number
.I num
to the list of incoming numbers of the
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name .
Numbers in this list are used to verify access permission of
the remote station if an incoming call is received. The verification
can be disabled by setting the interface into insecure mode using
.BI isdnctrl " name " secure " off."
If the list is empty, incoming calls are disabled.
More than one number can be added by calling
.B isdnctrl addphone
repeatedly. Also wildcards can be used (see below).
.TP
.BI delphone " name " in|out " num"
Removes phone number
.I num
from the incoming or outgoing phone list.
.TP
.BI eaz " name " [ num ]
Set the EAZ (German 1TR6 protocol) or MSN (Euro-ISDN E-DSS1) for
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name " to " num .
For an EAZ this is only one digit, while for an MSN
.I num
is the whole MSN (usually the local phone number). If
.I num
is omitted,
.B isdnctrl
prints the current setting for
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI huptimeout " name " [ seconds ]
Set the hangup timeout for
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name " to " seconds .
If there is inactivity (i.e. no traffic on the interface) for the
given time the driver automatically shuts down the connection.
If
.I seconds
is omitted
.B isdnctrl
prints the current setting for interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI cbdelay " name " [ seconds ]
Set the callback delay for
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name " to " seconds .
If callback mode for this interface is
.BR in ,
dialing is delayed the given time. If the callback mode is
.BR out ,
after dialing out and waiting the given time, a hangup is
issued to free the line for the incoming callback from the remote
machine. This hangup-after-dial is disabled by setting
.B cbdelay
to 0. If
.I seconds
is omitted
.B isdnctrl
prints the current setting for interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI dialmax " name " [ num ]
Set the number of dial attempts for
.SM ISDN
interface
.IR name " to " num .
If dialing, each phone number is tried this many times before giving up.
If
.I num
is omitted
.B isdnctrl
prints the current setting for interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI ihup " name " [on|off]
Turn on or off the hangup timeout for incoming calls on
interface
.IR name .
If on or off is omitted the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI chargehup " name " [on|off]
Turn on or off hangup before next charge info for interface
.IR name .
This can only be used if the
.SM ISDN
provider transmits charge info during and after the connection.
If set to on, the driver will close the connection just before the
next charge info will be received if the interface is inactive. If
on or off is omitted the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI chargeint " name " [ seconds ]
If
.I seconds
are given, the charge interval for the given
interface is set. This may be useful on
.SM ISDN
lines with no chargeinfo or no online chargeinfo. The connection
will be closed 2 seconds before the end of the next estimated
charge interval if 
.I huptimeout
seconds of inactivity have been reached. If 
.I ihup 
is
.BR on ,
incoming connections are closed by this mechanism also.
On lines with online charge info you also might ask by 
.BI chargeint " name"
for the current charge interval as delivered from the
telecom on a given interface.
.TP
.BI secure " name " [on|off]
Turns on or off the security feature for interface 
.IR name .
If set to
.BR on ,
incoming calls will only be accepted if the calling number can be
found in the incoming access list. See description of action
.B addphone
for information about how to add numbers to this list.
.RB If " on " or " off
is omitted, the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI callback " name " [ mode ]
Set callback mode for interface 
.IR name " to mode " mode .
If callback mode is
.BR in ,
then after getting an incoming call, a callback is triggered. If
callback mode is
.BR out ,
then the local system does the initial call and then waits for callback of
the remote machine. The option
.B on
is available only for compatibility with older versions. Its meaning is
the same like
.BR in .
If callback mode is
.BR off ,
calls are handled normally without special processing.
.TP
.BI cbhup " name " [on|off]
Turns on or off Hangup (Reject) for interface 
.I name
before starting callback. If cbhup is
.BR on ,
when receiving an incoming call, the interface first rejects that
call before the callback sequence is started. If
.BR on " or " off
is omitted, the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI encap " name " [ encapsulation ]
Set the encapsulation mode for interface
.IR name .
Possible encapsulations are:
.LP
.RS
.B rawip
.br
raw ip encapsulation (default)
.LP
.B ip
.br
IP + typefield encapsulation
.LP
.B cisco-h
.br
Special mode for communicating with a Cisco in HDLC-mode with
Cisco-keepalive switched off.
.LP
.B ethernet
.br
ethernet over
.SM ISDN
(MAC-header included)
.LP
.B syncppp
.br
Synchronous PPP over
.SM ISDN
.LP
.B uihdlc
.br
raw ip with additional ui-header
.LP
.B cisco-hk
.br
Special mode for communicating with a Cisco in HDLC-mode with
Cisco-keepalive switched on.
.LP
.B x25iface
.br
Provides an interface as required by the Linux X.25 PLP protocol
implementation (requires Linux 2.1.x or newer).
.RE
.LP
If
.I encapsulation
is omitted, the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI l2_prot " name " [ protocol ]
Set the layer-2 protocol for interface 
.IR name .
Possible values for 
.IR protocol " are:"
.br
.BR x75i ", " x75ui ", " x75bui " and " hdlc .
If
.I protocol
is omitted the current setting is printed.
.TP
.B l3_prot " name " [ protocol ]
Set the layer-3 protocol for interface 
.IR name .
At the moment only
.B trans
is supported here.
If
.I protocol
is omitted the current setting is printed.
.TP
.BI list " name"
List all parameters and the charge info for interface
.IR name .
If
.I name
is
.BR all ,
then all interfaces are listed.
.TP
.BI status " name"
Show the connection status for interface
.IR name .
The output can be one of the following types:
.RS
.LP
.B
ippp0 not connected
.br
There is no connection
.LP
.B
ippp0 connected to 0123456789
.br
There is an outgoing connection to phone number 0123456789
.LP
.B
ippp0 connected from 0123456789
.br
There is an incoming connection from phone number 0123456789
.RE

If the interface is connected, the exit status of the command is true,
else it is false.
.br
If
.I name
is
.BR all ,
then the connection status for all interfaces is shown. The exit status is
always true in this case.
.TP
.BI verbose " num"
Set verbosity level to
.IR num .
.TP
.BI hangup " name"
The connection of interface
.I name
is closed immediately. 
.TP
.BI bind " name driverId" , "channel " [exclusive]
Binds an interface
.I name
to a physical channel.
The
.I driverId
identifies a specific S0-Port. The channels of a port start
counting with zero. If 
.B exclusive
is given, other interfaces cannot use that channel anymore.
Otherwise, the channel may be used by other interfaces.
.TP
.BI unbind " name"
Unbinds a the previously bound interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI pppbind " name " [ num ]
Binds the interface
.I name
to an ippp device
.BI /dev/ippp num .
This works only for synchronous ppp. The value must be a number.
If
.I num
is omitted and
.I name
is called
.BI ippp X
, then the interface is bound to
.BI /dev/ippp X .
.TP
.BI pppunbind " name"
Unbinds the previously bound interface
.IR name .

.TP
.BI busreject " driverId " [on|off]
If switched
.BR on ,
instead of ignoring incoming calls not matching any interface,
isdn4linux responds with a
.B REJECT
to those calls. If switched
.BR off ,
isdn4linux is passive, allowing other devices connected to the same
S0-bus to answer the call.
You normally should
.B not
enable this feature, if the
.SM ISDN
adaptor is not the only device connected to the S0-bus.
Otherwise it could happen, that isdn4linux rejects an incoming call
which belongs to another device on the bus.

.TP
.BI addslave " name slave"
Adds a slave interface named
.I slave
to interface
.I name
for raw channel-bundling. For bundling of more than two channels, any number
of slaves can be added to an interface by using this command repeatedly.
.I name
must refer to an existing "master" interface (not a slave). Slave
interfaces are not visible to the kernel, however all usual
.SM ISDN
settings can be configured. Because slave interfaces are not visible
to the kernel, they are configured "through" their "master", so
.B it is important
that slave interfaces are added
.B before
the corresponding "master" is started by
.BR ifconfig .
If the "master" is already up, it has to be shutdown with
.B ifconfig down ...
otherwise the
.B addslave
command will be rejected.

.TP
.BI sdelay " name num"
Set delay for slave-dialing.
The master interface
.I name
has to have a load of more than
.B trigger
cps for at least
.I num
seconds, before its slave starts dialing.
.br
Note that this only works for rawIP, not MPPP!

.TP
.BI trigger " name num"
Set trigger level for slave-dialing.
The master interface
.I name
has to have a load of more than
.I num
cps for at least
.B sdelay
seconds, before its slave starts dialing.
.br
Note that this only works for rawIP, not MPPP!

.TP
.BI addlink " name"
For MPPP, this adds a slave interface to the existing connection,
i.e. connect the extra channel now. It is like a
.B dial
command for the extra channel.
.br
This also means that
.B addlink
will only work if the master interface
.I name
must already be connected! Also, the
.B dialmode
for the slave interface must be \fIauto\fR.

.TP
.BI removelink " name"
For MPPP, this removes a slave interface from the existing connection,
i.e. hangup the extra channel now.

.TP
.BI dial " name"
Force dialing of interface
.IR name .
.TP
.BI mapping " driverId MSN0" [, MSN1 [, MSN2 "]] ... [," MSN9 ]
Installs a mapping-table for MSN<->EAZ-mapping. See README for details.

.SH WILDCARDS
When using
.BI "isdnctrl addphone " name " in " num
to add phone numbers to the incoming-call accept-list of an interface,
wildcards similar to shell wildcards can be used.
The following wildcards are supported:

.TP 7
.B ?
one arbitrary digit
.TP 7
.B *
zero or arbitrary number of digits
.TP 7
.BI [ list ]
one of the digits in
.I list
.TP 7
.BI [ 1 - 5 ]
one digit in the range of (including)
.IR 1 " and " 5 .
.TP 7
.B ^
if this appears as the first character in a list, inverts the list.
