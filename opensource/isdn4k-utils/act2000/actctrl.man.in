.TH ACTCTRL 8 "@MANDATE@" isdn4k-utils-@I4LVERSION@ "Linux System Administration"
.SH NAME
actctrl \- configure IBM Active 2000 ISDN adaptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B actctrl [-d
.IB Driver-Id ]
.I action options
.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B actctrl
is used to setup the IBM Active 2000
.SM ISDN
device driver and for downloading the firmware into the
.SM ISDN
card.
.LP
The use of
.I actctrl
makes sense, if you are using an IBM Active 2000 card only.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " Driver-Id
selects the S0 interface named by
.IR Driver-Id .
Driver-Ids are defined during driver initialisation. See
.BR act2000 (4)
for a description of the syntax to be used for modularized and
monolithic driver versions.
This option
.B must
be used to identify the S0 interface if more than one S0 interface is
existent. If a single IBM Active 2000 is used, it may be omitted.
If using more than one card, support for the other cards is enabled
with the
.B add
action of actctrl. Ids may
.B not
start with
.B digits
or small
.BR x ,
because these values are misinterpreted
as numeric parameters by
.BR insmod .
For loading the module, always the
newest
.B modutils
package should be used to avoid problems during load.
.LP
The following 
.I actions
may be given to
.BR actctrl .
.TP
.BI "add [" bus "[ " port "[ " irq "[ " id ]]]]
enables support for an additional card in the driver.
.I bus
is is an integer describing the bus-type of the card. Currently,
the only value which is allowed here is
.B 1
meaning ISA-bus. In the future, the values
.B 2
(for MCA) and
.B 3
(for PCMCIA) will be available.
.I port
is either an integer describing the base port, or the string
.B auto
which enables autoprobing.
.I irq
is either an integer describing the IRQ to use, the string
.BR auto ,
which enables grabbing of the next free IRQ or the string
.B none
which enables polled mode for this card.
.I id
is an arbitrary string for referencing the card at a later time.
.TP
.BI "dproto " protocol " [" msn0 , msn1 ", ... " msn9 ]
selects the D-channel protocol and defines MSN's if using Euro protocol.
.I protocol
may be either the string
.B 1tr6
or the string
.BR euro .
If selecting Euro protocol, a comma-separated list of up to 10 MSN's
may be appended. For defining an empty entry in this list, use a dash.
.TP
.BI "load " firmware
downloads the firmware into the card and starts operation.
Usually the images are located in
.IR @CONFIG_DATADIR@ .
The firmware is named
.IR bip1120.bpl .
.TP
.B dump
is available if the program is configured using the
.B --enable-dump
option only. The contents of internal driver variables is dumped on stdout.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I @CONFIG_DATADIR@/bip1120.bpl
This is the image of the firmware designed for both the German 1TR6 protocol
and Euro ISDN.
.LP
.SH BUGS
No bugs so far.
