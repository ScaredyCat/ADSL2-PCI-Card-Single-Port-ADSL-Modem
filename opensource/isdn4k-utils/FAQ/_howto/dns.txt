I send to some people a small set of shell and example in order to set up a local name server on a Linux box.

I translate in aproximative english the README, which should in any case be easier to read that the french version.

Some people ask be for seting this in an ftp site unfortunately my university did not open yet an anonymous ftp.

All these shells are coming from Rennes Hight Brittany University they generate from /etc/hosts the DNS database, I modify them in order to run on my linux box.

(c) This is public program and you use them at your own risk
    they will probably not run without some adaptation to your site.

All this example refer to the following configuration ------------------------------------------------------------

      ---------------
      | to Internet |

        Unregistered 200.200.200" network, "domain sene.bzh"
            
Note: 

1)    This configuration give to all Slaves computer the impression
      to be officially onto Internet without really be registrated.    

2)    It allows to run a cache even when INTERNET dial-up connection
      is down.

3)    It obviously read news during the night, but this is an other story.


To Do in order to install DNS
------------------------------

If you are running a DNS at home like me you probably have to choose for an unregistrated domain name as me.
Running on an official Internet network does not change anything except that you don't have to worry about your name and your net number.


- If you don't want to place your DNS data base in
  /var/etc/named/DNS you will have to hack the shell
  almost everything is hard coded

- create the destination directory /var/etc/named/DNS

- Copy all etc/*header* file in  /var/etc/named/DNS then
  adapt them to your site [here: network is 200.200.200].

- Allow named to start at boot time, for this remove comment
  before named lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2

- copy etc/named.boot file in  /etc adapt it to your site
  primary & forwarders lines syntax is:

         PRIMARY myDomainename [here sene.bzh] headerPathName [here:sene.bzh.header.db] 
         FORWARDERS IP_NUMBER for your DNS parent [usually your provider].

  example
         primary    sene.bzh    /var/etc/named/DNS/sene.bzh.header.db
         forwarders 194.51.217.1 194.51.3.49

- Normally /etc/resolv.conf is not mandatory, nevertheless 
  I place my local domain name in with the following line.  

         domain sene.bzh

- .cache directive refer to a standard file that you should have no
   trouble with. Syntax is:

         cache . /var/etc/named/DNS/named.root

    NOTE: You can retrieve a more update named.root file true FTP  
          FTP.RS.INTERNIC.NET. (But for this named should work !!!)

- Build/update your /etc/hosts file. WARNING: all your local hosts  
  should have as main name   host.YourDomainName INCLUDING localhost.YourDomainName
          [see example in etc/hosts]

- Generate your DNS data base, this is the only thing you should have to
  do at each /etc/hosts change. In fact this job is done automatically
  with the following shell, syntax

          make_db            YourDomainName             [ex: make_db sene.bzh]
          make_in-addr.arpa  Net_Value.._in-addr.arpa   [ex: make_in-addr.arpa 200.200.200._in-addr.arpa]

  nota: These two commands should generate you the two following files 
        YourDomainName.db & Net_Value.in-addr.arpa.db
        in /var/etc/named/DNS. Both file are include from your
        header.db files.

- If you have secondary computers that use your local server,
  just write the two following line in there /etc/resolv.conf

         domain sene.bzh   [where sene.bzh is your domaineName]
         nameserver 200.200.200.1 [where 200.200.200.1 is your local DNS]

  WARNING:  NameServer should be an IP number and not a symbolic name
            and this even if it is declare in your /etc/hosts.

- It is now time to start your name server, by just typing in:   

         named

- Check your name server is effectively working

         dnsquery -h your_host_name 

WARNING:   Even if your dialup line with INTERNET is broken your 
           name server should answer you. The only time it should   
           timeout is when you type in a wrong name, it with case it
           should try reaching a forwarder.

Good Luck

ps: Sorry for the English, if someone want to set it up in real english
    I will be please to replace my own README with a better one.
