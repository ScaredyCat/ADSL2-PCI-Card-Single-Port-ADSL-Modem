Hello, (Robert here :-0 )

   The scripts I sent in are for the "built-in" function of ISDN4Linux
when
using the rawip/ethernet/...  encapsulation. PPP (SyncPPP) encapsulation
doesnt
seem to be supported for the "automatic" functions of I4L!

MIXING THE SLAVE (autodial/autohangup) functions with SyncPPP doesn't
work:
 1: reliably-  relying on the auto hangup appears to work until the 2nd
-> 5th
               time. Then the kernel gets "a bit" disturbed.

 2: Not at all- auto dial never works with syncPPP. As far as I know
(and can
                see), the only way to add channels to SyncPPP is to
MANUALLY
                "addlink" and "removelink" the devices.  Of course you
need to
                have the devices pre-defined for the I4L system and for
the PPP
                program.

I am still looking over (and into) these issues and hope to have more
later.
But for now I must say that the scripts I sent to the FAQ (and the
list?) are
for the rawip/ethernet encapsulations. SyncPPP is another animal (user
space)
and will require other links between the system (kernel) and the ppp
program
(user space).

I am also still (ja ja...) porting the ITK Columbus Card driver from
Frank Mohr
to the HiSax device driver system. (Thanks Karsten!!)
