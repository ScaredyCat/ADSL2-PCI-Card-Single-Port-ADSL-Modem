Source code in directories src and src/lib is subject to the
`GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE' [ LGPL ], refer to COPYING.LIB.
It is copyrighted by Henner Eisen.
Although some files will not build as a library but as unix
executables, they are licensed under the LGPL nevertheless.
This permits you to use them under the terms of the GPL as well as
modifying them such that they become part of a library which can be
licensed under the terms of the LGPL.

Source code in directory src/authlib is subject to different licenses
(a BSD style license with advertisment clause). Refer to COPYING.auth
for further details.

Note that with the default configuration, eftd needs src/authlib to
work. With former versions of eftp4linux, some license restrictions
of authlib conflicted with the LGPL.

As of eftp4linux-0.0.3, the authorization routines are attached to the
EUROFILE state machine code at run time by means of function calls and
parameters. Thus, a server using the eftp4linux library and
attaching authlib is a work that uses the library (the LGPL'ed
code) in the sense of the LGPL. Thus, there is no problem with
distributing eftd binaries any more (and the specially granted
permissions necessary in eftp4linux-0.0.2 are obsolete now).

Note that the eftp client program is linked with the GNU readline
library which is licensend under the GPL. Thus, the eftp binary
automatically is subject to the GPL, even though the sources of eftp
itsself are licensed under the LGPL (which explicitly permits to
to also licence the code under ther GPL).
