# MSNs to be used be eurofile server and client.
#
# (yes, I'm aware that some countries don't provide MSNs, then the
# config scripts need to be tuned by others means)
#
# For minimizing trouble when trying out the test-installation:
# - Choose different MSNs for the client and the server.
# - If other (non-eurofile) isdn network interface are active while
#   you are testing eftp4linux, choose MSNs different from those other
#   isdn network interface MSNs. (otherwise, you need to tune the
#   default scripts)

# As currently the eurofile client script "eftp.sh" needs to be run as
# root in order to configure the network interfaces, that script will
# su to a regular user id before it starts the eft client "eftp".
# Set this to the user id under which the client shall run
# (this is a temporary config variable which will be removed soon
# because the eftp.sh script is now obsolete)

# define this if you want x25trace debugging output
# EFTD_X25TRACE=1
#
# If this is set then you can test eurofile client and server locallay
# on top of the isdnloop HL driver (no external isdn connection
# required). To do so, just type `eftp -x 1 -u USER' (where USER is
# your login name)
