                ---   why do you repeat the ifconfig?
                      probably it should be "ippp1" here?

With this I do not agree. It is simply possible to give two interfaces the same local ip address. You may even establish two routes on them. But only the first one found in the routing table will be used by the kernel. So the other route won't have any effect.

Configuring two interfaces with the same local IP address does make sense if you want to use as less IP adresses as possible (very honorable as long as IPv6 is not common practice).
An interface IP-Adress is used by the kernel to give outgoing packets (not the forwarded packets) a sender IP address within the IP header.

To make the IP address 193.89.84.10 (as used in the above example) pingable I would suggest the following (changes ar marked at the right margin):

| ifconfig dummy0 193.89.84.10    # module has to be loaded before | route add -host 193.89.84.10    # only to have 193.89.84.10 reachable
                                  # all the time

  isdnctrl addif ippp0
| ifconfig ippp0 down       # to make it exclusively bindable
  isdnctrl pppbind ippp0
| ifconfig ippp0 193.89.84.10 p-t-p 193.89.84.11 up | route add -host 193.89.84.11 metric 1 ippp0 | route add -net 194.192.159.0 metric 1 \ |       netmask 255.255.255.224 gw 193.89.84.11
  ipppd user XXX1 /dev/ippp0 193.89.84.10:193.89.84.11 \
        file /etc/ppp/options.ippp0

  isdnctrl addif ippp1
| ifconfig ippp1 down       # to make it exclusively bindable
  isdnctrl pppbind ippp1
| ifconfig ippp1 193.89.84.10 p-t-p 193.89.84.13 up | route add -host 193.89.84.13 metric 1 ippp0 | route add -net 192.168.1.0 metric 1 \ |       netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 193.89.84.13
  ipppd user XXX2 /dev/ippp1 193.89.84.10:193.89.84.11 \
        file /etc/ppp/options.ippp1


You may even try the following to "emulate" cisco's dialer rotary group where you may put several BRIs (basic rate interfaces = ISDN S0 [gr.]) into one netmask. Therefore the example would look like (changes aren't marked any more; completely different):

  #!/bin/bash

  # assuming, we are using a network of
  #   193.89.84.0/255.255.255.240
  # for a dial up server where
  #   193.89.84.1     is the IP for the server    and
  #   193.89.84.2-14  are the addresses for remote interfaces.

  ifconfig dummy0 193.89.84.1     # module has to be loaded before
  route add -host 193.89.84.1     # only to have 193.89.84.1 reachable
                                  # all the time

  USER_ippp0="XXX1"
  RMTNET_ippp0=194.192.159.0
  RMTMSK_ippp0=255.255.255.224

  USER_ippp1="XXX2"
  RMTNET_ippp1=192.168.1.0        # masquerading is great!
  RMTMSK_ippp1=255.255.255.0

  USER_ippp2="XXX3"
  RMTNET_ippp2=""                 # you may leave 'em blank
  RMTNET_ippp2=""                 # if there is no remote net

  [...]                           # fill out to your needs

  for x in 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
  do
    IFNAME="ippp$[$x-2]"
    isdnctrl addif $IFNAME
    ifconfig $IFNAME down       # to make it exclusively bindable
    isdnctrl pppbind $IFNAME
    ifconfig $IFNAME 193.89.84.1 netmask 255.255.255.240 up
    route add -host 193.89.84.$x metric 1 $IFNAME
    eval NET="\${RMTNET_${IFNAME}}"
    eval MSK="\${RMTNET_${IFNAME}}"
    if [ -n "$NET" -a -n "$MSK" ]
    then
      route add -net $NET metric 1 netmask $MSK gw 193.89.84.$x
    fi
    eval USER="\${USER_${IFNAME}}"
    ipppd user "$USER" /dev/$IFNAME 193.89.84.1:193.89.84.$x \
          file /etc/ppp/options.$IFNAME
  done


No warranty, it's untested.
But please yell at me (politely) if I'm wrong.


Regards,

  Torsten
