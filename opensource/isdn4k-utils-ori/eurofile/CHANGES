$Log: CHANGES,v $
Revision 1.9  2000/01/26 20:11:33  he
Fixed a y2k bug, several typos, and removes absolute pathnames for
utilities execuded by eftd.sh

- [fix] fileheader.c: fixed y2k bug (cosmetic, only
	affected display output of eftp's xdir command).
- [chg] eftd.sh.in: utility programs are now located using the
	standard search PATH rather than by absolute path name.

Revision 1.8  1999/10/11 21:22:23  he
more isdn4k-utils install changes

- [imp] config/autoconf changes. Partially changed autoconf parameter
	names. Support `make install'. Improved integration in
	isdn4k-utils menu config.
- [imp] Makefile: "install" target will try to create symlinks
	/etc/isdn/eft{access,users} to /etc/ftp{access,users} such
	that default access control will be the same as for ftp.

Revision 1.7  1999/10/06 18:16:21  he
removed some dead code and pipe proof command line reading (eftp)


- [imp] eftp.c: new cmd read implementation. Should now work under any
	circumstances such as when reading from a pipe. readline()
	support can now also be disabled by command line option -r.
	

Revision 1.6  1999/10/05 21:23:20  he
glibc2 compatibility and misc other cleanups

- [chg] src/eft* #include <stdlib.h> where needed for realpath()
	(for glibc2 support)
- [imp] added paranoia check in eftd.c authentification handling.
- [imp] wuauth/{main,access,acl}.c: reject login if access file is required
	but opening or reading fails
- [imp] wuauth/{*.c,config.h}: changed ordering of #include's and added
	some conditional #define's to suppress glibc2 warnings
 

Revision 1.5  1999/07/26 22:04:24  he
eftp suid support


- [imp] eftp.c, eft_i4l.c: suid support with isdn connect permission
	check added.
- [chg] eftd.sh, eft.conf and several other doc files modified to
	reflect above changes

Revision 1.4  1999/07/25 21:55:25  he
Changes for eftp supervisor based call control

- [chg] eft_i4l.c: Replaced calls to external programmes (isdnctrl,x25_route,
	ifconfig, scripts) by directly calling ioctl()'s.
- [new] eft_i4l.c: Support for supervisor based isdn call control.
- [chg] eftp.c: Supporting above supervisor based isdn call control.
	(prepares eftp for use by non-root users).
- [chg] eftp_setup: Removed, no longer needed with above changes.
- [fix] eftd.sh: Moved isdnloop setup before iface setup such that script
	will also work if no other HL drivers are present.
- [chg] Makefile: Dummy "install" target to keep isdn4k-utils root makefile
	happy.

 
Revision 1.3  1999/06/30 22:00:27  he

Version 0.0.11

===============
Revision 1.2  1999/06/29 18:37:10  he
Were initially missing or wrong

- [new] doc/design.txt added (needs completion)
- [chg] src/*: changed directory names and structure which also affects
	#include directives and Makefiles.
- [chg] The config file (former /etc/isdn/eft.msn) has been renamed to
	eft.conf. If you want want to re-use an already installed
	config file, you also need to rename it. Otherwise, the new
	script files won't find it.
- [chg] Support for CVS in build procedure.

--------------
Version 0.0.10
--------------
- [fix] tdu_buf.c::tdu_parse_li():   fixed base (255 -> 256)
- [imp] eft_server.c, eft_dir.c, eftd.c, eft.c: modified (also format
	changes!!) and added more LogBook messages.
- [fix] tdu_log.c::tdu_mk_printable:   proper handling for len<0
	(cures previous segmentation faults).
- [imp] eftd.sh.in: automatically remove '-m' option when EFTD_DEBUG=1
	(for debugging under gdb) is set.

-------------
Version 0.0.9
-------------
- [imp] eftd.c, eftp.c, tdu_log.c: support for udata and address
	logging.
- [fix] eftd.sh EFTD_OPTIONS set from from eft.msn could be lost.
	Clarified some comments.
- [imp] eftd.c Proposed some locations for end of session LogBook messages. 

-------------
Version 0.0.8
-------------
- [fix] Updated README, ETSI standards now available free of charge.
- [new] 18.02.1999, ms@msdatec.de
    eftd.8.sgml created.
- [chg] 17.02.1999, ms@msdatec.de
	src/lib/eftc, set_default_adress: Now using combination of
	gethostname() and gethostbyname() because getdomainname()
	didn't work as expected. 
- [imp] eftd.sh: (based on patch provided by Matthias Stolte)
	Better custumization by means of more variables.
- [imp] eftd.sh: (based on suggestion from Knuth Posern)
	Support for several different MSNs on different
	interfaces. This allows the server to accept connections
	from different S0 interfaces which cannot use a common MSN.
- [imp] tdu_log.c and several other files: Changes in logging
	infrastructure (in particular for a supporting an eft log
	file facilty). (loggin to log file with several processes
	in parallel has not been tested yet and might cuase problems).
- [chg]	eftd.c, doc/eftd: The log changes imply changes for eftd's
	command line interface. New option -b for selecting log[book]
	file. Removed -v. New semantics for -l -d and -L.
	This might break old script files.
- [chg]	eft_names.c, eft_server.c, eft_dir.c: some modification in
	filename-transfername-mapping.

Version 0.0.7
-------------
Integrated Michael Mauch's improved readline and mget/mput support:

  instead of read
- [chg] read_line.c removed
- [chg] src/Makefile and configure.in adapted for readline support.

Fixes for glibc2 compatibility (thanks to Michael Dietrich)
- [fix] eftp.c, eftd.c: sigset now initialized by utility functions.
- [fix] eft_names.c: errno.h included.
- [fix] eft_tmpfile.c zeroed struct stat instances before symlink
	attack paranoia check.
Misc
- [chg] moved eft_map_to_user() handling to eft_server.c and change to
	default user only if user is not in passwd database. This also
	fixes a bug (username wrong in logfile output).
- [fix] eft_dir.c::eft_valid_dent_s_k() now only selects symlinks that
	refer to regular files.
- [fix] eft_names.c::eft_file_is_hidden() added missing resetting of errno
- [fix] eft_server.c::eft_log_xfer() use eft->user_name for username field
- [imp] eft_dir.c: (several locations) modified generation of
	filestore references. Now, no longer should any client have an
	excuse to break on this.
- [imp] eftd.c can now listen simultaneously on different X.25
	adresses
