What ist it?

modilp is a small kernel module providing /proc/isdninfo. This file shows
the connection state of 2 ISDN B-Channels.
The information shown in /proc/isdnlog is written by isdnlog in the states
CONNECT and RELEASE.
For best usage (all devices on the S0 bus shown) you should use a HFCS-based
ISDN card or a second reversed card (s. FAQ).


Installation

  Kernel 2.4.x

  - Modify drivers/isdn/Makefile:

  obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN) 	+= isdn.o
  obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN) 	+= modilp.o	#<<<<<<<<< INSERTED

  
  Kernel 2.0.x (2.2 ??)
  
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_ISDN),m)
    M_OBJS += isdn.o
    M_OBJS += modilp.o         #<<<<<<<<<< INSERTED

  - copy modilp.c to drivers/isdn/
  
  - "make dep" after modifying the Makefile
  - then build your kernel as usual  "make modules modules_install"
  

  or manually

  Adjust Makefile for your kernel-gcc and options, then 
  $ make

  
  $ su -c "insmod modilp.o"
  $ cat /proc/isdnlog

  $ make ilp
  $ su -c "./ilp"
  $ cat /proc/isdnlog

  should show a dummy entry
  

  Make isdnlog:

  $ cd ../..
  $ make clean
  $ make ILP=1
  
  as root, copy bin/isdnlog to /sbin/isdnlog and restart em.
  
  watch /proc/isdnlog
  
  
  to revert to old isdnlog do:
  
  touch isdnlog/processor.c isdnlog/functions.c
  make
  

TODO

After this integrate into build process.
Remove PRT_INFO in modilp.c.

Have fun!
