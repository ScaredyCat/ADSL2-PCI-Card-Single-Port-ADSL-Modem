 * rewrote the ASN.1 parsing stuff. No known problems so far, apart from the
 * following:
 *
 * I don't use buildnumber() anymore to translate the numbers to aliases, because
 * it apparently did never work quite right. If someone knows how to handle
 * buildnumber(), we can go ahead and fix this.
