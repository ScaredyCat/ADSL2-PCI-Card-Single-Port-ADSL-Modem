.SH NAME
isdnformat \- common isdn config file format

.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page describes the format of all isdn config files.

.SH FORMAT
Empty lines are ignored.

If a # is encountered, this character and the rest of the line is
ignored (it's considered a comment). You can prepend a backslash \\ to
prevent this and use the # character.

If the last character of a line is a backslash \\, the next line is
a continuation of the current line.

The file format is like smb.conf or win.ini: there are sections and
entries within the section. However, the syntax was expanded with
subsections; these can be nested as often as you like.

All whitespace (space and tabs) at the end of the
line are ignored.

Section and entry names are case insensitive.

Values are case sensitive, of course (the case is preserved).

Section and entry names may not use the characters "*?|&/"; if one of
these is encountered, it is ignored.

At the beginning of the line you may use as much whitespace
as you like.

A section has the format "[" NAME "]". You may use whitespace
between the braces and the name, or none at all.

An entry has the format ENTRY "=" VALUE. You may use
whitespace before and after the equal sign, or none at all.

A subsection starts with ENTRY "=" "{"  and ends with "}". You may use
sections, entries and subsections between the start and the end tag.

Beware: unlike samba or windows the semicolon is 
.B not
used for comments !

You can use
.B INCLUDE(File)
to include a file. If the filename is not absolute, it's considered
relative to the directory of the including document. You may use it
anywhere in a file, but there may be no space characters in the
file!

All subsections started in an include file must end in that include
file, so the number of opened and closed brackets must match.

Beware: recursive including will cause the program to break. The
library does not prevent this.
