.TH ISDNCONF 1 "@MANDATE_ISDNCONF@" isdn4k-utils-@I4LVERSION@ "Linux System Utilities"
.SH NAME
isdnconf \- manipulate or read ISDN phone number config files.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI isdnconf 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I isdnconf
can manipulate or read the file 
.I @I4LCONFDIR@/@CALLERIDFILE@
as well as \fI~/.isdn\fR.
Entries can be added or removed from these files. Additionally, entries
can be searched for and displayed in a way similar to \fBgrep\fR.
An entry can be an own MSN (\fB[MSN]\fR) or a phone number
(\fB[NUMBER]\fR).

You can use this program to build your own phonebook. These files are
used by many of the other ISDN utilities that use phone numbers, to
display a number symbolicly instead of as a plain number.

.SH OPTIONS
Note: usage of the options -A and -D is dangerous! The
complete structure of the file may be changed, and all comments are
removed! Make backups of your data files before trying these.

.B COMMAND OPTIONS:
.PP
.TP 4
.B \-A
Add a new entry, which is read from standard input. The following
values are asked for (here with examples):
.RS
.nf

Alias:          Fred
Number:         0815/441777
SI:             0
Zone:           4
Interface:      -
Flags:          I|O
Program:        /usr/local/bin/ring
User:           uucp
Group:          user
Interval:
Time:           8-20
Flags:          (control-D here indicates end of flags)

Alias:          (control-D here indicated end of entries)

.fi
If you want another [Flags] entry, simply enter the data for another
program for this number at the point where the control-D was given
above.

If you want to add another number, simply enter the data for the next
number at the Alias prompt.

You can also pipe the data into this program; the input data then must
correspond to the prompts that the program gives! Note that you can
only add one number at a time then (there's no way of telling
.I isdnconf
that you want to stop giving Flags info and start giving the next
Alias info).

.RE

.TP
.B \-D
Delete one or more entries which match the data options given. How to
supply the data to match is discussed below (see \fBDATA OPTIONS\fR).

.TP
.B \-V
version: display the program's version and terminate.

.PP

If both -A and -D are given together,
.I isdnconf
will terminate, as this is not a valid combination.

If neither -A nor -D is given, then
.I isdnconf
will display entries which match the data given.

.B DATA OPTIONS:
(none applicable for -A)
.TP 4
.B \-n 'number'
number: match the given number. It can contain wildcards.

.TP
.B \-a 'alias'
alias: match the given alias name. The name can contain wildcards.
Note: due to a bug, use '?' instead of '-'.

.TP
.B \-t 'SI'
SI: match the given service indicator.

.TP
.B \-c 'code'
code: match the area code of the phone number. Only usable for displaying
(not for -A nor -D).

.TP
.B \-i
ignore case for the -n and -a options.

.TP
.B \-w
word: the parameters for -n and -a must match the
.B whole
value, not just a substring.
.RS
Examples (here for -n):
.nf

"*34*" matches 123456, 345677, 1234
"34*"  matches 34567, 34111 but not 1234
"34??" matches 3411, 3456
"34"   matches only 34

.fi
Without the -w option, these would match:
.nf

"*34*" matches 123456, 345677, 1234
"34*"  matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 34567, 34111
"34??" matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 3411, 3456
"34"   matches 123456, 345677, 1234, 3411, 3456, 34567

.fi
.RE

.TP
.B \-d
and: by default the values given to options -n, -a and -t will be combined
with a logical OR. If these should be combined with a logical AND
(which is probably what most people expect!) you must use this -d option.
In this case you can only supply each of the -n, -a and -t options
exactly once.

.TP
.B OTHER OPTIONS:
.TP
.B \-q
quiet: when using the -A or -D commands, the output is suppressed.
When not using the -A or -D commands, only the alias of the matching
number is shown, or just the number in case the alias is not found.

.TP
.B \-m
MSN: when used in combination with the -A command, instructs
.B isdnconf
to create a new MSN entry; the default is to create a new NUMBER
entry. Only the values alias, number, SI, zone and interface are
applicable to an MSN entry.

.PP
The following two options do not apply to the -A and -D commands. They
only change the output format.

.TP 4
.B \-s
short: only display the alias and the number.

.TP
.B \-l
long: also display the programs to run (\fB[START]\fR).

.TP
.B \-f 'filename'
file: usually
.B isdnconf
uses the
.I @I4LCONFDIR@/@CALLERIDFILE@
and the
.I ~/.isdn
files. If
.B isdnconf
should be applied to another file, use this option.

.TP
.B \-g
global: only applies to the -A and -D commands. Instead of editing
\fI~/.isdn\fR,
.I @I4LCONFDIR@/@CALLERIDFILE@
is edited.

.TP
.B \-1
first: only delete or display the first entry.

.TP
.B \-M
isdnmon: used internally by isdnmon to get alias info.
