changed/new isdnlog options / parameters

# -I			ciInterval="value[:value2]"
# Print chargeint (CI) and AOC-D (EH) messages every value / value2 seconds.
ciInterval=60:120

# -d			abclcr="value"
# Do active LCR for outgoing calls from your isdn card.
# ATTENTION: SEMANTICS CHANGED
#
# Value is a bitmap:
#	0 ... off
#	1 ... calls to different area / country
#	2 ... local calls too
#	4 ... special numbers e.g. ISP
# This needs a kernel patch to work. If the kernel patch is not found
# a simulation is done.
# Note: depending on your telefon provider local area calls may or may not
# be routed to alternate providers.
# For changing the ISP a script is called. s. next option 'providerchange'
abclcr=3

#			providerchange="path_top_script"
# (There is no commandline option for this)
# This script is called with 3 parameters, the new provider number
# (fron rate-CC.dat) the number, which would be dialed, and the servicename.
# The script should adjust routing, name resolution and so on to
# connect to the ISP.
# If the script returns non zero, LCR will not be done.

providerchange = /etc/isdn/provider

Note: you have to adjust this script.
