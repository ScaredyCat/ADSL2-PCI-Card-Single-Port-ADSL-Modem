This is an implementation of the Constant Data Base (cdb),
s. more in README

The main interface to i4l-tools is the file i4l_cdb.c, which
simulates a DB-interface. The higher level routines are in cdb.c.

The original cdb is from
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/source/utils/freecdb_0.61.tar.gz

Currently only the utility cdbmake is used, so you don't have to
install the cdb package.
