You will need "eiconctrl" to activate and to load an active card
with the necessary firmware provided by Eicon Technology.
These firmware binaries are part of this package and will be installed
in a specified directory.

In addition, this utility provides some trace and debug features.

If you want to use isdnlog with your active Eicon card, the good
news are, you can activate this with the command

   eiconctrl isdnlog on

(off course, you can deactivate this using "eiconctrl isdnlog off").
The bad news are, this is only possible with the
DIVA Server BRI card or the DIVA Server 4BRI card.

NOTICE : 
In order to use other isdn4linux features, like isdn-net-devices or
isdn feature and monitoring tools, you will need other parts from
the isdn4k-utils package.
