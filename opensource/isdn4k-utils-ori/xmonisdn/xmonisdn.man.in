.SH NAME
xmonisdn \- monitor for ISDN network
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmonisdn
[ \-\fItoolkitoption\fP ... ] [ \fI\-option\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xmonisdn
program displays the status of the ISDN network connection and allows
the starting and stopping of the ISDN subsystem. If the ISDN subsystem is not
active, a window showing a terminal in the foreground and a dashed
terminal in the backgorund is displayed. If the ISDN system is active,
but there is no network connection established, two terminals with
dashed arrows between them is displayed. If there is a incoming
connection or there is dialing in progress, the arrows become more
solid. An outgoing network connection is signaled by solid arrows
between the terminals and the window is displayed in reverse video.
If the ISDN subsystem dials out or hangs up, the program beeps to signal
the state change (this can be changed using the 
.I volume 
option).
.PP
Pressing button 2 on the window executes the command
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@
and pressing button 3 executes
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_DOWNCMD@
.br
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@
and
.I @CONFIG_XMONISDN_DOWNCMD@
should start and stop the ISDN subsystem;
if the
.ul
route
command is used, xmonisdn must be run as setuid root for this to work.
Alternatively, the scripts can manipulate the
.ul
isdnctrl dialmode
setting, in which case only permission to access /dev/isdnctrl is needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xmonisdn
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the
additional options listed below:
.TP 8
.B \-help
This option indicates that a brief summary of the allowed options should be
printed on the standard error.
.TP 8
.B \-update \fItenth of a second\fP
This option specifies the frequency in 1/10 of a second at which \fIxmonisdn\fP
should update its display.  If the window is obscured and then exposed,
it will be updated immediately.  The default is 0.5 seconds (i.e. -update 5).
.TP 8
.B \-file \fIfilename\fP
This option specifies the name of the file which should be monitored.  By
default, it watches /dev/isdninfo.
.TP 8
.B \-volume \fIpercentage\fP
This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when  there is an important status change.
.TP 8
.B \-shape
This option indicates that the xmonisdn window should be shaped if masks for
the  images are given.
.PP
The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with 
.I xmonisdn:
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the xmonisdn window.
The icon is 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels high and will be centered in
the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.  
.TP 8
.B \-bd \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of the window.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.
.SH X DEFAULTS

Specifies that the foreground and background should be reversed.
.TP 8

.SH ACTIONS
The \fINetstat\fP widget provides the following actions for use in event
translations:
.TP 8
.B check()
This action causes the widget to check the isdninfo file and display the appropriate icon.
.TP 8
.B netdown()
This action causes the widget to execute @CONFIG_XMONISDN_DOWNCMD@ stop.
.TP 8
.B netup()
This action causes the widget to execute @CONFIG_XMONISDN_UPCMD@ start.
.PP
The default translation is 
.sp
.nf
        <ButtonPress>Button2:  netup()
	<ButtonPress>Button3:  netdown()
.fi
.sp

.SH SECURITY ISSUES
There are a number of reasons why you should not run
.I xmonisdn
as a `setuid root' program.
Most importantly, any setuid root program is a potential security hole.
The scripts that are executed by
.I xmonisdn
may be compromised, or contain non-absolute paths to the commands called
(so that by changing the PATH variable the wrong binary is executed!);
or the script may in turn call other things that are not secure.
.br
If you are sure that your scripts are secure and you insist on making
.I xmonisdn
setuid root, you can give the
.B -r
option as
.I first
option. This will turn off xmonisdn's setuid detection. However, you are on
your own if you do this!
.br

A better alternative is to put the isdn devices in group
.B dialout
(if not so already), and add yourself to the
.B dialout
group. This way you have permission to manipulate the ISDN devices, e.g.
to use
.I isdnctrl
to change the dialmode setting to off (to disable dialing) or auto (for
autodial). The whole ISDN system may also be turned on and off, see the
.I isdnctrl manpage for more info.
This is a more secure way of controlling the dialing than e.g. by
manipulating routes.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
