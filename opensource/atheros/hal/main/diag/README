This directory has tools that use the diagnostic interface to fetch data.  Note that most of these can only be used (currently) when the
HAL is buil with AH_PRIVATE_DIAG enabled.

dumpregs	extract registers and print their contents
eeprom		pretty print the parsed contents of the EEPROM (5211, 5212)
rfgain		print the current RFGAIN settings (5211, 5212)
ani		print the current ANI settings and the ANI statistics (5212)
txpow		print the calculated rate and pcdac tables (5212)
key		get/set entries in the key cache (the 5212 key cache
		    is read/write, for 5211 you need to enable reading
		    by writing the eeprom, and noone has answered how to
		    enable reading the 5210 key cache)

Note that these tools do very little error checking so if they are
out of sync wrt the HAL they can easily do the wrong thing.
