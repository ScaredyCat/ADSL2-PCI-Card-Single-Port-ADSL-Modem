merit-2.4.21-CHAP.diff

	Patch to the Merit radiusd 2.4.21 to support the CHAP-Challenge
	attribute.  Doesn't work with earlier version of Merit radiusd. I sent

radiusd-1.16.accounting.diff

	The patch for Livingston's (now Lucent's) radiusd 1.16 fixes the
	accounting reply digest bug. When you've applied this patch to your
	RADIUS server you no longer need to compile radiusclient with
	--enable-radius-116. This patch was contributed by Tilman
	Mueller-Gerbes <tmg@suse.de>. Thanks, Tilman!
