    <H2>Design aims</H2>
    <P>We're working on a generic Linux subsystem for memory devices, 
      especially Flash devices.
    </P>
    <P>The aim of the system is to make it simple to provide a driver for new
      hardware, by providing a generic interface between the hardware drivers
      and the upper layers of the system.
    </P>
    <P>Hardware drivers need to know nothing about the storage formats used,
      such as FTL, FFS2, etc., but will only need to provide simple routines
      for <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt> and <TT>erase</TT>.
      Presentation of the device's contents to the user in an appropriate form
      will be handled by the upper layers of the system.
    </P>

    <H2>Download and CVS</H2>

    <P>Very occasionally, I make snapshot releases. Now that the MTD code
      is in the 2.4 kernel, it's become even rarer. Your best option is to
      obtain the latest code from CVS, by following the instructions below.
      We do break the CVS build occasionally, but we're also fairly good
      at fixing it quickly when we do so. </P>

    <P>Anonymous CVS access is available, and full CVS access may also be
      granted to developers on request.
      <PRE>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs login <I>(password: anoncvs)</I>
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs co mtd
    </PRE>
   
    <P>If you can't access anoncvs for some reason, daily snapshots 
      are also available at <A 
      HREF="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/">
	ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/</A>
    </P>
    <HR size=2>
    <H2>Installation</H2>
    <P>Check out sources from CVS or download a snapshot and untar it. Change to the
       top directory and read INSTALL. Change to subdir patches. There you find a script <B>patchin.sh</B>.
       It is highly <B>recommended</B> to use this script, as it is aware of different kernel versions,
       pristine or already patched kernels.
       This script applies all the neccecary changes to your kernel source <B>including</B> the often discussed
       <B>shared zlib patches</B>. Your kernel source must be configured already, as the script retrieves 
       information from Makefile in your kernel source.<br>
       The script takes following options: <br>
       <I>
       -c copy files into kernel tree instead of linking files<br>
       -j include jffs(2) filesystems<br>
       </I>
       As last argument you have to give the path of your kernel tree. This must be an absolute
       path.</P>
       <P>The difference between linking and copying files into the kernel tree is, that copying 
       gives you a modified kernel tree, which can be handled by CVS as it contains no symlinks.
       Linking the files has two advantages. <br>
       1. All your kernel trees can share the same MTD source.<br>
       2. You can have more than one MTD source eg. a stable and an unstable and use it with
       your kernel tree(s) by changing the link to the directories.
       Assumed you have two MTD versions (stable and unstable) and those are located in source,
       then the directory listing of source shows:<br>
       <I>
       mtd->/source/mtd.stable<br>
       mtd.stable<br>
       mtd.unstable<br>
       </I>
       If you want to build with your stable MTD source, set the mtd link to mtd.stable else to 
       mtd.unstable. Don't forget to make clean, if you switch the links.

    <H2>Documentation</H2>
    <P>There is now some <A HREF="tech/">MTD API documentation</A> available.
      It's a little out of date - the API has been evolving over the last
      few months as we encounter strange pieces of hardware that we hadn't
      anticipated, and occasionally when I'd just overlooked something
      blatantly obvious. Volunteers to update the docs are welcome.
      <br><br>13th Feb 2001: A <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/mtd/mtd-jffs-HOWTO.txt">mtd-jffs-HOWTO</A> is now also available under
    CVS. Not all topics are covered yet, but it's a start.
      <br><br>5th May 2002: A <A HREF="tech/nand.html">NAND Flash</A> document is now available. It covers
      some technical topics about NAND and filesystems and contains a HOWTO.
    </P>

    <h2>Booting</H2>
    <P>You can now replace the firmware on the DiskOnChip 2000, and possibly 
    also the DiskOnChip Millennium, with a version of <A 
      HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU Grub</A> which runs directly
    from the flash.</P>

    <P>The patches to make Grub aware of the DiskOnChip and the NFTL format
      used on it, along with a first-stage loader to load Grub itself into
      memory from the DiskOnChip, are in the CVS repository.</P>

    <h2>MTD <I>User</I> modules</h2>
    <P>These are the modules which provide interfaces that can be used
      directly from userspace. The user modules currently planned include:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Raw character access:</B><BR>
	A character device which allows direct access to the underlying 
	memory. Useful for creating filesystems on the devices, before 
	using some of the translation drivers below, or for raw storage 
	on infrequently-changed flash, or RAM devices.
      </LI>
      <LI><B><A NAME="mtdblock">Raw block access</a></B><BR>
	A block device driver which allows you to pretend that the flash
	is a normal device with sensible sector size. It actually works
	by caching a whole flash erase block in RAM, modifying it as
	requested, then erasing the whole block and writing back the modified
	data.<BR>
	This allows you to use normal filesystems on flash parts. Obviously
	it's not particularly robust when you are writing to it - you lose
	a whole erase block's worth of data if your read/modify/erase/rewrite
	cycle actually goes read/modify/erase/poweroff. But for development,
	and for setting up filesystems which are actually going to be
	mounted read-only in production units, it should be fine.
	<BR>
	There is also a read-only version of this driver which doesn't have
	the capacity to do the caching and erase/writeback, mainly for use
	with uCLinux where the extra RAM requirement was considered too
	large.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Flash Translation Layer (FTL)</B></LI>
      <LI><B>NFTL</B><BR>
	Block device drivers which implement an FTL/NFTL filesystem on the 
	underlying memory device. FTL is fully functional. NFTL is currently
	working for both reading and writing, but could probably do with 
	some more field testing before being used on production systems. 
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Journalling Flash File System, v2</B><BR>
	This provides a filesystem directly on the 
	flash, rather than emulating a block device. For more information,
	see <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/">sources.redhat.com</A>.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <HR SIZE=2>
    <h2>MTD hardware device drivers</h2>
    <P>These provide physical access to memory devices, and are not used 
      directly - they are accessed through the <I>user</I> modules above.</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>On-board memory</B><BR>
	Many PC chipsets are incapable of correctly caching system memory
	above 64M or 512M. A driver exists which allows you to use this
	memory with the linux-mtd system.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>PCMCIA devices</B><BR>
	PCMCIA flash (not CompactFlash but <em>real</em> flash) cards are
	now supported by the <TT>pcmciamtd</TT> driver in CVS.
      <LI><B>Common Flash Interface (<A 
	    HREF="http://www.pentium.com/design/flcomp/technote/cfi_1_1.htm">CFI</A>)
	  onboard NOR flash</B><BR>
	This is a common solution and is well-tested and supported, most
	often using JFFS2 or cramfs file systems.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Onboard NAND flash</B><BR>
	NAND flash is rapidly overtaking NOR flash due to its larger size 
	and lower cost; JFFS2 support for NAND flash is approaching production
	quality.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>M-Systems' DiskOnChip 2000 and Millennium</B><BR>
	The DiskOnChip 2000, Millennium and Millennium Plus devices should
	be fully supported, using their native NFTL and INFTL 'translation
	layers'. Support for JFFS2 on DiskOnChip 2000 and Millennium is 
	also operational although lacking proper support for bad block 
	handling.
	<HR>
	</LI>

      <LI><B>CompactFlash</B> - <A HREF="http://www.compactflash.org/">http://www.compactflash.org/</A><BR>
	CompactFlash emulates an IDE disk, either through the PCMCIA-ATA 
	standard, or by connecting directly to an IDE interface.
	<BR>As such, it has no business being on this page, as to the best of
	my knowledge it doesn't have any alternative method of accessing the 
	flash - you <I>have</I> to use the IDE emulation - I mention it here
	for completeness.
