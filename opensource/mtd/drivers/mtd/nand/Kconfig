config MTD_NAND
	tristate "NAND Device Support"
	depends on MTD
	help
	  This enables support for accessing all type of NAND flash
	  devices with an 8-bit data bus interface. For further 
	  information see www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/tech/nand.html.

config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_NAND_AUTCPU12
	tristate "SmartMediaCard on autronix autcpu12 board"
	depends on ARM && MTD_NAND && ARCH_AUTCPU12
	help
	  This enables the driver for the autronix autcpu12 board to 
	  access the SmartMediaCard.

config MTD_NAND_EDB7312
	tristate "Support for Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation board"
	depends on ARM && MTD_NAND && ARCH_EDB7312
	help
	  This enables the driver for the Cirrus Logic EBD7312 evaluation 
	  board to access the onboard NAND Flash.

config MTD_NAND_SPIA
	tristate "NAND Flash device on SPIA board"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_P720T && MTD_NAND
	help
	  If you had to ask, you don't have one. Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_TOTO
	tristate "NAND Flash device on TOTO board"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_OMAP && MTD_NAND
	help
	  Support for NAND flash on Texas Instruments Toto platform.

config MTD_NAND_IDS
	tristate
	default y if MTD_NAND = y || MTD_DOC2000 = y || MTD_DOC2001 = y || MTD_DOC2001PLUS = y
	default m if MTD_NAND = m || MTD_DOC2000 = m || MTD_DOC2001 = m || MTD_DOC2001PLUS = m

config MTD_NAND_TX4925NDFMC
	tristate "SmartMedia Card on Toshiba RBTX4925 reference board"
	depends on TOSHIBA_RBTX4925 && MTD_NAND && TOSHIBA_RBTX4925_MPLEX_NAND
	help
	  This enables the driver for the NAND flash device found on the
	  Toshiba RBTX4925 reference board, which is a SmartMediaCard.

config MTD_NAND_TX4938NDFMC
	tristate "NAND Flash device on Toshiba RBTX4938 reference board"
	depends on TOSHIBA_RBTX4938 && MTD_NAND && TOSHIBA_RBTX4938_MPLEX_NAND 
	help
	  This enables the driver for the NAND flash device found on the
	  Toshiba RBTX4938 reference board.

config MTD_NAND_AU1550
	tristate "Au1550 NAND support"
	depends on SOC_AU1550 && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the driver for the NAND flash controller on the
	  AMD/Alchemy 1550 SOC.

config MTD_NAND_PPCHAMELEONEVB
	tristate "NAND Flash device on PPChameleonEVB board"
	depends on PPCHAMELEONEVB && MTD_NAND
	help
	  This enables the NAND flash driver on the PPChameleon EVB Board.
